># [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) <img src="app/assets/images/googleMapsLogo.png" align="right" alt="Google Maps logo" width="" height="100">

Google Maps from now on is used as an extension within our secure back office (reserved for Rocket Elevators employees) in order to geolocate our customers buildings on a map and display statistics on a location:
* Location of the Buildings
* Number of floors in the building (If the information is available)
* Client name
* Number of Batteries
* Number of Columns
* Number of Elevators
* Full name of technical contact

The geolocation page is in the Admin section of the website, available only to authenticated members.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
># [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) <img src="app/assets/images/twilioLogo.png" align="right" alt="Twilio logo" width="200" height=""> 

Twilio’s API supports virtually all forms of communication within an application and allows integration of communications between diverse experiences regardless of the platforms on which they were built.

For Rocket Elevators, Twilio can be used to allow the platform to get in touch with the technicians in case of problems.

If the status of an Elevator in the database changes to "Intervention" status, the building's technical contact must be identified and an SMS must be sent to the telephone number associated with this contact.

In this case, the designated contact will be the coach assigned to our team, David Amyot, and he will receives the alerts on his mobile phone.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
># [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/pt-br/) <img src="app/assets/images/slackLogo.png" align="right" alt="Slack logo" width="250" height=""> 

Rocket Elevators greatly benefit from synergy between all of the company's collaborators by using the very open and flexible Slack API.

The Backoffice in particular is able to publish messages on Slack to leave written records and inform about certain events that occur through its infrastructure.

In the current use case, when a controller changes the status of an elevator, this status is reflected in the information system and persists in the operational database . When these status changes occur, a message is sent to the slack: 

**“elevator_operations” channel to leave a written record."**

The written message must have the following format:

The Elevator **[Elevator’s ID]** with Serial Number **[Serial Number]** changed status from **[Old Status]** to **[New Status]**

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
># [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) <img src="app/assets/images/dropboxLogo.png" align="right" alt="Dropbox logo" width="250" height=""> 


  Dropbox website and account informations: 
  - Webpage: https://www.dropbox.com/
  - Login: rocketelevators2@gmail.com
  - Password: Pa$$w0rd!!


Dropbox API and its online storage allows Rocket Elevators to archive their documents in the clouds in a simple and flexible way while allowing access to the file from anywhere, thanks to the multiple interfaces provided by Dropbox.

When a contact becomes a customer, that is to say when the “Customers” table in the information system can be linked to a record in the “Leads” table, which itself offers the possibility of uploading files in a binary field of the table, it is necessary to trigger an archiving procedure which: 

1. Connect to the Rocket Elevators DropBox account
2. Create a directory in DropBox on behalf of the client if the client does not already exist
3. Extract the file stored in the binary field of the MySQL database
4. Copy this file to the client DropBox directory
5. If the document is successfully downloaded to Dropbox, the controller deletes the content of the binary field from the database to avoid duplication

># [IBM Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson) <img src="app/assets/images/watsonLogo.png" align="right" alt="IBM Watson logo" width="200" height=""> 

IBM through its Artificial Intelligence Watson provides application developers with many services. Among the most used, there is a Text-to-Speech functionality which can be used on a multitude of platforms.

With IBM Watson, Rocket Elevators adds text-to-speech functionality to their Home Dashboard (/ admin). Everytime the Admin Dashboard page appears, there is the option to start the briefing.

The type of information that speech synthesis allows are the following:

1. Greetings to the logged users
2. There are currently XXX elevators deployed in the XXX buildings of your XXX customers
3. Currently, XXX elevators are not in Running Status and are being serviced
4. You currently have XXX quotes awaiting processing
5. You currently have XXX leads in your contact requests
6. Batteries are deployed across XXX cities

To provide the type of voice summary described, it is necessary to execute the appropriate queries in the database to collect the relevant data. Then it forms sentences in English and combine them with the data collected.
